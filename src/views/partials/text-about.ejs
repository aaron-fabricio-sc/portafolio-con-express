    About Me
  </h2>
  <p class="text-center mt-3 sm:text-xl">
    I am a lover of music and software development. My vision is to generate
    digital solutions through programming.
    <br />
    <br />

    My career begins in 2017 while I was studying at the University I began to
    carry out my first programming projects.
    <br />
    <br />
    I am currently a web developer with knowledge of technologies focused on the
    frontend. Expert in layout of pages, sites and web applications.
    <br />
    <br />

    Curious by nature I am a self-taught person I like to learn about new
    technologies to implement them in new projects.
    <br />
    One of my goals is to be a fullstack developer focused on building web
    applications.
    <br />
    My last roles are Frontend Developer collaborating in the design of web
    pages and applications.
    <br />
    I can identify new opportunities and strategically think through different
    scenarios to achieve sustainable goals.
